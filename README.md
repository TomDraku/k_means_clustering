This project implements K-Means clustering to analyze admissions data from a dataset of 777 universities, aiming to identify potential clusters of universities based on various admission-related characteristics.

Data Description

The dataset consists of a DataFrame containing 777 observations (universities) and 18 variables:

Private: Categorical (Yes/No) indicating whether the university is private or public.
Apps: Number of applications received.
Accept: Number of applications accepted.
Enroll: Number of new students enrolled.
Top10perc: Percentage of new students from the top 10% of their high school class.
Top25perc: Percentage of new students from the top 25% of their high school class.
F.Undergrad: Number of full-time undergraduate students.
P.Undergrad: Number of part-time undergraduate students.
Outstate: Out-of-state tuition fees.
Room.Board: Room and board costs.
Books: Estimated cost of textbooks.
Personal: Estimated personal spending by students.
PhD: Percentage of faculty with Ph.D. degrees.
Terminal: Percentage of faculty with terminal degrees.
S.F.Ratio: Student-to-faculty ratio.
perc.alumni: Percentage of alumni who donate to the university.
Expend: Instructional expenditure per student.
Grad.Rate: Graduation rate.
Project Goals

Preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for K-Means clustering. This might involve handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical features if necessary.
Apply the K-Means algorithm to group universities into a user-defined number of clusters (k).
Analyze the resulting clusters and identify insights about universities within each cluster. Potential findings could include similarities in admission rates, tuition fees, faculty composition, or student demographics.
Visualize the clusters using scatter plots or other dimensionality reduction techniques to gain a better understanding of the relationships between variables.
Evaluate the performance of the clustering by calculating metrics like silhouette coefficient or Calinski-Harabasz index (depending on the chosen library).
(Optional) Experiment with different values of k to determine the optimal number of clusters for the data. This might involve exploring cluster quality metrics or silhouette analysis.
Python Libraries

The project will utilize Python libraries commonly used for data science tasks:

pandas for data manipulation and DataFrame operations.
NumPy for numerical computations and array manipulation.
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, specifically the KMeans class for clustering.
matplotlib or seaborn for data visualization (creating scatter plots and other visualizations).
(Optional) Other libraries like scipy for more advanced statistical analysis or plotly for interactive visualizations.
